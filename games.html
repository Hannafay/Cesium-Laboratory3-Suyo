           <p> My favorite game is Mobile Legends: Bang Bang because it is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game designed for mobile phones.
		   The game is free-to-play and is only monetized through in-game purchases like characters and skins.
		   Each player can control a selectable character, called a Hero, with unique abilities and traits.
